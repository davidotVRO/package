2. config-logical:- This creates an XML file that includes all logical configuration settings such as service profiles, VLANs, VSANs, pools, and policies.
3. config-system:- This creates an XML file that includes all system configuration settings such as usernames, roles, and locales.
4. config-all:- This creates an XML file that includes all system and logical configuration settings.]]></description>
